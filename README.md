## The Relation Data Model

Gained a comprehensive understanding of the relational data model, including concepts of relations, attributes, tuples, keys, and constraints that form the foundation of relational database systems.

## Database Modelling and Design

Mastered the principles of database design, including entity-relationship modeling, normalization techniques, and the process of translating conceptual models into efficient relational schemas.

## SQL

Developed proficiency in SQL, with a focus on advanced features such as window functions for complex data analysis and OLAP functions for multidimensional data processing in business intelligence applications.

## Relational Algebra

Studied the fundamental operations of relational algebra, including selection, projection, union, set difference, and join, which form the theoretical basis for querying relational databases.

## Database Architecture

Explored various database architecture models, including centralized, distributed, and client-server architectures, along with their implications for performance, scalability, and data management.

## Transactions Processing and Concurrency Control

Learned about transaction management, ACID properties, concurrency control mechanisms, and isolation levels to ensure data consistency and integrity in multi-user database environments.

## Indexing, Query Processing and Optimization

Delved into indexing techniques, query execution plans, and optimization strategies to enhance database performance and efficiency in handling complex queries on large datasets.

## Security and Access Control

Studied database security principles, including authentication mechanisms, access control models, encryption techniques, and auditing practices to protect sensitive data and ensure regulatory compliance.
